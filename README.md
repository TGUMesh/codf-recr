# Backend

This project uses a Node.js + Express backend with MongoDB for data storage. The backend implements authentication (JWT), role-based access control, and RESTful APIs for clubs, events, users, students, and faculty.

## Main Features
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access (admin, president, faculty)
- CRUD for clubs, events, users
- Member management
- MongoDB data models

See backend/README.md for API details (to be created).
